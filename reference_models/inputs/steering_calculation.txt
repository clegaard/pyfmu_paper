L = wheelbase
T = trackwidth

R = turning radius of the vechicle
delta_c is the wheel turning angle in radians  

R = L / tan^-1(delta_c);

delta_outer = tan^-1(L/(R+0.5T))   //in radians
delta_inner = tan^-1(L/(R-0.5T))   //in radians


And if R is large means that delta_inner and delta_outer is 0 => the car drives straight.
